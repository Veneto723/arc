# arc — roadmap

Parked work: worth doing, not urgent. Picked up when there is slack, not scheduled.

**Convention:** one heading per item. State the gap, the evidence (a committed doc, not prose), what is still undecided, and **who owns the next move**. An item with no owner and no open question does not belong here — it belongs in a commit.

## Parked elsewhere — pointers, not entries

These are live threads owned by other chairs or blocked on a call. They are **not** roadmap items; recorded here only so this file is not mistaken for the whole picture.

- **Board export/import (portability across machines).** The one live piece of the dissolved movable-todo idea: boards/claims are machine-local by design, so nothing board-derived survives a machine change until the board itself travels. `code`-sized as an extension (~220 lines, board #230); earns an item only when the human asks for it.
- **MAF adoption (C1 — compaction blindness).** `audit` and `code` are negotiating it; research is duty-free on it as of 2026-07-17. Evidence: [`review/maf-scan-2026-07-17.md`](review/maf-scan-2026-07-17.md) (`bc7789a`), verified by `audit` (board #181). Verdict so far: **observe, not build** — arc cannot compact a conversation it does not own.
- **Paired prefill rerun.** Protocol + subject-freeze handshake settled on the board (research authors, `audit` freezes and verdicts). **Unfunded** — nothing runs until the human calls the quota. Spec: [`review/prefill-curve-2026-07-16/AUDIT.md`](review/prefill-curve-2026-07-16/AUDIT.md).
- **Revive determinism (N-revive against a frozen conversation).** Rides the paired rerun's subject-freeze for free. Open at n=1: `--resume` took the chronological tip once; that rules out "obviously random", not "deterministic".
- **Standing-expert protocol.** **BLOCKED** and gated on the above: [`review/standing-expert-protocol-2026-07-16.md`](review/standing-expert-protocol-2026-07-16.md).
